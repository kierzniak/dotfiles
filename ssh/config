  # Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received
  # from the server, ssh will send a message through the encrypted channel to
  # request a response from the server. The default is 0, indicating that these
  # messages will not be sent to the server. This option applies to protocol
  # version 2 only.
  ServerAliveInterval 60

  # The default value is 3. If, for example, ServerAliveInterval is set to 15
  # and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default, if the server becomes
  # unresponsive, ssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds. This
  # option applies to protocol version 2 only.
